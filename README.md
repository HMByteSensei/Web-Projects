# Web-Projects

A collection of web development projects, each organized in its own directory. These projects were created as I learned **HTML** and **CSS**, focusing on building structured and visually appealing web pages.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5** – Structuring web pages.
- **CSS3** – Styling and layout design.
