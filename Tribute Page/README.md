# Tribute to the Turing Machine

Welcome to the **Turing Machine Tribute Page**, where we celebrate one of the most fundamental concepts in computer science. This project is dedicated to invention of the **Turing Machine**, a theoretical model that helped shape the modern digital world.

## ðŸ’¡ About the Turing Machine

The Turing Machine is an abstract device that manipulates symbols on a strip of tape according to a table of rules. Despite its simplicity, the machine is capable of performing any computation that can be algorithmically expressed. 

### Key Concepts:
- **Tape**: Infinite memory storage where data is read and written.
- **Head**: Reads and writes symbols and moves across the tape.
- **State Register**: Keeps track of the current state of the machine.
- **Table of Rules**: A set of instructions that dictate the machine's actions.
