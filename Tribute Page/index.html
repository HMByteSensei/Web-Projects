        <h3 id="headline">Here is an overview of Turing Machine:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Invented by Alan Turing in 1936:</strong> Turing machines were first described by Alan Turing, a mathematician and computer scientist, who originally called it an "a-machine" (automatic machine).</li>

          <li><strong>Mathematical Model of Computation:</strong> A Turing machine is an abstract machine that manipulates symbols on a tape according to a set of rules. Despite its simplicity, it can implement any computer algorithm, making it a powerful model for understanding computation.</li>
          <li><strong>Used for Recursive Enumerable Languages:</strong> Turing machines accept Recursive Enumerable Languages (languages generated by Type-0 grammar), providing insight into language theory in automata.</li>

          <li><strong>Components of a Turing Machine:</strong>
            <ul id="components">
              <li><strong>Infinite Tape:</strong> The machine operates on an infinite tape divided into discrete cells, each containing a symbol from a finite alphabet.
              <li><strong>Read-Write Head:</strong> A head moves along the tape, reading, writing, or erasing symbols based on the machine's current state and the symbol in the cell.</li>
              <li><strong>Finite Set of States:</strong> The machine operates based on a finite set of states, where each state defines what the machine does (write, move, or halt) based on the current symbol and state.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Operation and Control:</strong> The Turing machine works by following a transition function, which dictates the machine's actions (writing symbols, moving the head left or right) based on the current state and the symbol being read.
          </li>
          <li><strong>Accept and Reject States:</strong> A Turing machine operates until it reaches an accept or reject state. If it halts at an accept state, the computation is successful; otherwise, it fails.
          </li>
          <li><strong>Impact on Computer Science:</strong> Turing machines laid the foundation for modern computing theory and have had a profound impact on understanding the nature of algorithms and computational complexity.
          </li>
        </ul>
